# Milestone 3: Search Algorithm (For Maze Exploration)

## Introduction
The goal of this milestone was to implement a search algorithm that would allow our robot to fully explore a maze of any configuration. In order to visit every square in a maze with an arbitrary configuration of walls, the robot has to decide where to go  Additionally, we showed that our robot was capable of updating the information that it collects as it explores the maze to the GUI.
