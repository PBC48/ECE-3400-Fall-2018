# Lab 1 Demonstration and Results
## Introduction

The purpose of lab 1 is to learn introductory Arduino programming through the Arduino IDE and Arduino Uno as well as to gain exposure to prototyping a robot. Through the completion of the lab, we became familiar with basic Arduino functionalities. We worked with Arduino I/O ports as well as serial communication for LED, servo control, and communication using built-in Arduino functions. We used Arduino built-in functions to read analog inputs and set the I/O pins on the Arduino Uno. The lab culminated with the team building a functional robot that could drive in a square.

## Blink

	We set up blinking on the Uno built-in IDE by using an Arduino example code. This was done by going to File -> Examples -> 1.Basics-> Blink. After opening the file, we compiled and uploaded the code onto the Uno using the right arrow button.
