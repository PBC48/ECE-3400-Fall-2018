# Milestone 1: Line Follower

## Introduction

The goal of this milestone was to add functionality enabling our robot to both follow a straight line and run in a figure eight pattern.  To accomplish this task, we added line sensors to the robot and implemented code to follow the lines and turn as directed at intersections.

## Hardware Upgrades

### Chassis upgrade

We added a second level to the robotâ€™s chassis to support our battery, the arduino, and a breadboard for our circuits. The breadboard allowed us to connect more components requiring more ground and power sources than are available directly on the Arduino.  With a common ground and source on the breadboard, we were able to connect the line sensors to the Arduino.

### Line Sensor Update

We used QRE1113 line sensors, which work by transmitting and then detecting IR light that reflects back to the phototransistor on the sensor. We used digital pins to detect how long it takes to charge the phototransistor -- the return values indicate a light or dark surface. These sensors are mounted at the front of the robot facing downward, with the sensors only a few centimeters above the ground to maximize sensor accuracy. 

Our first design idea used three line sensors -- two for staying on the line and a third for detecting intersections.  In our final implementation, we were able to use software to perform all the required tasks using only two sensors.

## Software Design

### Obstacles

### Follow the Line

```cpp
if(SENSOR1_READING < 400){ //turning right
    turn_right();git pulu
}else if(SENSOR0_READING < 400) { //turning left
    turn _left();
}else{
    forward();
}
```
